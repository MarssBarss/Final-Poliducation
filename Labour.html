<h2><u>Who are they?</u></h2>

<p><b>By definition, 'the Labour Party is a centre-left political party in the United Kingdom that has been described as an alliance of social democrats, democratic socialists and trade unionists. In all general elections since 1922, Labour has been either the governing party or the Official Opposition.' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)">[1]</a></b></p>

<div>Within the UK, the Labour party leader is Keir Starmer (elected in April 2020), the successor to Jeremy Corbyn. Starmer has been a Member of Parliament since 2015.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Labour_Party_(UK)">[2]</a> </div>

<h2><u>What do they stand for?</u></h2>

<p><b>Currently, the 5 main aims of the Labour Party are to have: no income tax rise for anybody earning less than £80,000 a year - but a tax rise for the top 5% of earners; £250bn to be pumped into the economy to finance a million new jobs; renationalise the railways, Royal Mail and bring in state-owned energy companies; eliminate higher education tuition fees; strengthen trade union rights - including increased unionisation across the workforce and repealing last year's Trade Union Act.<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-39849601">[3]</a></b></p>

<div>Labour has only been in government for four short periods of the 20th century. However its achievements have revolutionised the lives of the British people. The values Labour stands for today are those which have guided it throughout its existence. They are:
<li> social justice</li>
<li> strong community and strong values</li>
<li> reward for hard work                         </li>
<li> rights matched by responsibilities</li>
<li> decency</li> <a href="https://semipartisansam.com/2015/08/23/what-are-the-aims-and-values-of-the-labour-party/">[4]</a></div>

	<h2><u>A brief history</u></h2>
	<p><b>The Labour Party was founded in 1900 by, having grown out of the trade union movement and socialist parties of the 19th century. It overtook the Liberal Party to become the main opposition to the Conservative Party in the early 1920s, forming two minority governments under Ramsay MacDonald in the 1920s and early 1930s. The party was originally called  the 'Labour Representation Committee' (LRC)</b></p>
	<div>
		While the Labour party were still trying to find their footing so as to be viewed as a viable government party, they were in no way comparable to the Conservatives at the time. They faced some hardships as they slowly built up their reputation, too. For example, they struggled during the first World War, as they didn't knoe whether to oppose or support it. Soon after however, (in 1918 - the year that the war ended) the party reorganised itself, adopted a new constitution and published a manifesto, 'Labour and the New Social Order'. It advocated the nationalisation of industry and the redistribution of wealth. This new release garnered them 63 seats in the 1918 election. Additionally, they won 142 seats within the next election of 1922; this number further crept up as they won 191 seats in the election of 1924, second only to the Conservatives with 258.
