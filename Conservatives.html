<h2><u>What do they stand for?</u></h2>

<p><b>Conservatives generally believe that there exists a transcendent moral order, to which we ought to try to conform the ways of society. They prefer continuity, and custom, conventional practices over newer ones. It is believed by conservatives that what has worked will continue to work, and so there is no reason to change, however, this is for things that allowed people to live in peace together. On the other hand, another core value of the Conservative party is pragmatism, they realise that there needs to be a working relationship between governed and government.<a href="https://isi.org/intercollegiate-review/the-six-core-beliefs-of-conservatism/">[3]</a></b></p>

<div>They also believe in: individualism, people should take responsibility for their actions; inequality, while they realise that it has negative connotations, they believe it is neessary for society to progress; human nature and imperfection, humans are imperfect and cannot be changed; and private property, they stress the importance of property as a way for people to have an unwavering place within society and to contradict socialism. <a href="https://revisionworld.com/a2-level-level-revision/politics/conservatism">[4]</a></div>

	<h2><u>A brief history</u></h2>
	<p><b>The Conservative Party developed from a group of people who were called Tories (which was where the nickname that we use today stemmed from) in the late 1600s. At the time, there were no organized political parties. The Tories were lawmakers who supported the king against Parliament. In 1783 the people voted for the Tories to be in power. Their leader, Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger, governed the country during the time of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. During this period, official parties began to form and gain names. By 1830 the Tories had become the Conservative Party. These were the humble beginnings of the conservatives, but modern day conservatism began in the 1860s, when Benjamin Disraeli came into power.</b></p>
	<div>
		While Benjamin was in power, the party gained alot of popularity with the people as well as royalty, the monarch in power was Queen Victoria at the time. The party supporters were mainly initially majority wealthy landowners, Disraeli wanted to make this to expand to the middle class and workers. In 1915 the Conservatives joined with the Liberal Party to govern the country during World War I. Their leader, Stanley Baldwin, was a popular politician with his party and the people. The party remained in power for most of the next 20 years. Baldwin was Conservative leader until 1937, when Neville Chamberlain took over as both prime minister and party leader. After World War II broke out, politicians grew angry at Chamberlain’s poor leadership and he was forced to resign in 1940. Winston Churchill took over as prime minister for the duration of the war. The party lost power in 1945. In the years that followed, Conservatives created a new youth movement, called Young Conservatives. They also became involved in education and research, and sought out new members. The party returned to power in 1951 and maintained office until 1964. During this time they modernized their policies. They also accepted that many of the welfare changes that had been brought in by Labour governments should stay. The Conservative prime ministers during this period were Sir Anthony Eden, Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home. From 1964 to 1979 the Conservatives held power alternately with the Labour Party. Edward Heath was prime minister from 1970 to 1974. In 1979 the Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher became the first British female prime minister. She was followed by John Major in 1990.
