<div>It is the third-largest political party within the UK (after Labour and Conservatives) and it's the largest party in Scotland where it has 48 out of the total 59 Scottish seats within the House of Commons. The current leader of the SNP is Nicola Sturgeon, and she has been the leader since November of 2014 after Alex Salmond stepped down following a referendum.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party#:~:text=Debate%20within%20the%20party%20focused,sought%20to%20put%20Scotland%20first.&text=Party%20policies%20supported%20the%20economic,the%20post%2Dwar%20welfare%20state.">[1]</a> </div>

<h2><u>What do they stand for?</u></h2>

<p><b>The Scottish National Party ideology aligns with mainstream European social democratic traditions: commitments to same-sex marriage, unilateral nuclear disarmament, progressive personal taxation, reducing the voting age to sixteen and investment in renewable energy. As a party, they are against Brexit; Nicola Sturgeon has come down firmly in favour of the UK remaining within the EU, or re-joining it if Scotland becomes independent.</b></p>

<div>In their recent manifesto, they also wished to: press the UK government to invest in public services and the economy; introduce a bill to protect the health service from privatisation and future trade deals; tackle Scotland's drugs crisis
by devolving drug classification powers to Holyrood (the Scottish Parliament); demand the UK government matches Holyrood's climate change targets; pass power over immigration to the Scottish Parliament so Scotland can have a migration system that works for its economy and society; increase the provision of paid leave for parents and encourage dads to take more time off (paternity leave); and give Holyrood power over train services to build better, greener public transport.<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50561073">[2]</a></div>

	<h2><u>A brief history</u></h2>
	<p><b>The SNP was formed in 1934 through the merger of the National Party of Scotland and the Scottish Party, with The Duke of Montrose and Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham as its first, joint, president. Sir Alexander MacEwen was its first chairman. Professor Douglas Young, who was the leader of the Scottish National Party from 1942 to 1945 campaigned for the Scottish people to refuse conscription and his activities were popularly vilified as undermining the British war effort against the Axis powers. Young was imprisoned for refusing to be conscripted.

</b></p>
	<div>
		The party suffered its first split during this period with John MacCormick leaving the party in 1942, owing to his failure to change the party's policy from supporting all out independence to Home Rule at that year's conference in Glasgow. McCormick went on to form the Scottish Covenant Association, a non-partisan political organisation campaigning for the establishment of a devolved Scottish Assembly. However, wartime conditions also enabled the SNP's first parliamentary success at the Motherwell by-election in 1945, but Robert McIntyre MP lost the seat at the general election three months later. The 1950s were characterised by similarly low levels of support, and this made it difficult for the party to advance. Indeed, in most general elections they were unable to put up more than a handful of candidates. The 1960s, however, offered more electoral successes, with candidates polling credibly at Glasgow Bridgeton in 1961, West Lothian in 1962 and Glasgow Pollok in 1967. Indeed, this foreshadowed Winnie Ewing's surprise victory in a by-election at the previously safe Labour seat of Hamilton. This brought the SNP to national prominence, leading to the establishment of the Kilbrandon Commission.
