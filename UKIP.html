<h2><u>Who are they?</u></h2>

<p><b>By definition, the UK Independence Party is a Eurosceptic, right-wing populist political party in the United Kingdom. As of 2020 it has a single Member of the Senedd. The party reached its greatest level of success in the mid-2010s, when it gained two members of Parliament and was the largest UK party in the European Parliament. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Independence_Party">[1]</a></b></p>

<div>The party is currently led by Freddy Vachha, with former acting leader Pat Mountain as Deputy Leader. UKIP originated as the Anti-Federalist League, a single-issue Eurosceptic party established in London by Alan Sked in 1991. It was renamed UKIP in 1993 but its growth remained slow. It was largely eclipsed by the Eurosceptic Referendum Party until the latter's 1997 dissolution. In 1997, Sked was ousted by a faction led by Nigel Farage, who became the party's preeminent figure. In 2006, Farage officially became leader and under his direction the party adopted a wider policy platform and capitalised on concerns about rising immigration, in particular among the White British working class. This resulted in significant breakthroughs at the 2013 local elections, 2014 European elections, and 2015 general election. The pressure UKIP exerted on the government was the main reason for the 2016 referendum which led to the UK's commitment to withdraw from the European Union. Farage then stepped down as UKIP leader, and the party's vote share and membership heavily declined. </div>

<h2><u>What do they stand for?</u></h2>

<p><b>UKIP is an avid supporter of Brexit. They also back selection by ability and would encourage the creation of new grammar schools. UKIP says they have no plans to fundamentally change the NHS - they would, however, shrink the Department of Health and hand control to locally elected County Health Boards. They would also restore "traditional" non-university training for nurses. They are sceptical about the existence of man-made climate change and would scrap all subsidies for renewable energy. They support the concept of civil partnerships, but oppose the move to legislate for same-sex marriage, which it says risks "the grave harm of undermining the rights of Churches and Faiths to decide for themselves whom they will and will not marry".<a href="https://isi.org/intercollegiate-review/the-six-core-beliefs-of-conservatism/">[3]</a></b></p>

<div>They would also like to:  double prison places and protect "frontline" policing to enforce "zero tolerance" of crime; they favour flat tax - a single combined rate of income tax and national insurance paid by all workers. They claim this would end the complexity of the current system and allow people to keep more of the money they have earned; and they want a five year freeze on immigration for permanent settlement - and any future migration must be strictly limited to those who can "clearly be shown to benefit the British people as a whole and our economy". Immigrants would not be able to apply for public housing or benefits until they had paid tax for five years.

	<h2><u>A brief history</u></h2>
	<p><b>As formerly mentioned, UKIP began as the Anti-Federalist League, a Eurosceptic political party established in 1991 by the historian Alan Sked. The League opposed the recently signed Maastricht Treaty and sought to sway the governing Conservative Party toward removing the United Kingdom from the European Union (EU). A former Liberal Party candidate, member of the Bruges Group, and professor at the London School of Economics (LSE), Sked had converted to Euroscepticism while teaching the LSE's European Studies programme. Under the Anti-Federalist League's banner, Sked was a candidate for Member of Parliament (MP) for Bath at the 1992 general election, gaining 0.2% of the vote. At a League meeting held in the LSE on 3 September 1993, the group was renamed the UK Independence Party, deliberately avoiding the term "British" so as to avoid confusion with the far-right British National Party (BNP).</b></p>
	<div>
		UKIP's support increased during the 2004 European Parliament elections, when it placed third, securing 2.6 million votes (16.1%) and winning twelve seats. This had been made possible through increased funding from major donors and the celebrity endorsement of chat show host Robert Kilroy-Silk, who stood as a candidate in the East Midlands.In 2006, Farage was elected leader. To attract support, he cultivated an image of himself as a "man of the people", openly smoking and drinking, showing disdain for the established parties, and speaking in an open manner that appeared unscripted. He sought to broaden UKIP's image from that of a single-issue party by introducing an array of socially conservative policies, including reducing immigration, tax cuts, restoring grammar schools, and climate change denial. In doing so he was attempting to attract disenfranchised former Conservatives who had left the party after its leader, David Cameron, had moved in a socially liberal direction. In March 2014, Ofcom awarded UKIP "major party status". In the 2014 local elections, UKIP won 163 seats, an increase of 128, but did not take control of any council. In the 2014 European Parliament elections, UKIP received the greatest number of votes (27.5%) of any British party, producing 24 MEPs. The party won seats in every region of Britain, including its first in Scotland. It made strong gains in traditionally Labour voting areas within Wales and the North of England; it for instance came either first or second in all 72 council areas of the latter. The victory established Farage and UKIP as "truly household names". It was the first time since 1906 that a party other than Labour or the Conservatives had won the most votes in a UK-wide election. In the 2017 local elections, UKIP lost all 145 seats it was defending, but gained one on Lancashire County Council. These results led several prominent former UKIP members to call for the party to be disbanded. In the following 2017 general election, UKIP received fewer than 600,000 votes and won no seats. The following day, Nuttall resigned and Steve Crowther took over as interim party leader. In July 2017, it lost its majority on Thanet council when Councillor Beverly Martin defected to the Conservatives; in September all three UKIP councillors on Plymouth council defected to the Conservatives, as did Alexandra Phillips, who had been UKIP's Head of Media for three years.
