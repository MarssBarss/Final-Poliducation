<div class="fact"><b><i>The Green Party were the first to: have one female leader hand over to another; have a BAME leader or deputy leader; and they are the only major political party in the UK that elects their leader for a term, rather than indefinitely!</i></b></div>

<div class="text2">
<h2><u>What do they stand for?</u></h2>

<p><b>The Green Party believes in "an economy that works for all". This includes radical steps to eliminate poverty with ambitious social policies such as increasing the minimum wage in line with the living wage. They also want to introduce a four-day working week to increase productivity. The party states that it would discontinue fossil fuel-based power generation, and would work toward closing coal-fired power stations as soon as possible. The Green Party would also remove subsidies for nuclear power within ten years and work towards phasing out nuclear energy. They aim for the UK to become carbon neutral. <a href="https://policy.greenparty.org.uk/core-values.html">[2]</a></b></p>

<div>They also believe that: a healthy society is based on voluntary co-operation between empowered individuals in a democratic society, free from discrimination; the success of a society cannot be measured by narrow economic indicators, but should take account of factors affecting the quality of life for all people: personal freedom, social equity, health, happiness and human fulfilment; and finally, the Earth's physical resources are finite. We threaten our future if we try to live beyond those means, so we must build a sustainable society that guarantees our long-term future.</div>

	<h2><u>A brief history</u></h2>
	<p><b>The Green Party of England and Wales has its origins in the PEOPLE Party, which was founded in Coventry, Warwickshire, in February 1972. It was renamed to The Ecology Party in 1975 and, in 1985, changed again to the Green Party. In 1989, the party's Scottish branch split to establish the independent Scottish Green Party, with an independent Green Party in Northern Ireland developing shortly after, leaving the branches in England and Wales to form their own party. In the 1989 European Parliament elections, the Green Party polled 15% of the vote with 2.3 million votes, the best performance of a "green" party in a nationwide election. This election gave the Green Party the third-largest share of the vote after the Conservative and Labour parties, although because of the first-past-the-post voting system (only the party with the most votes succeeds), it failed to gain a seat. Many say the success of the party is due to increased respect for environmentalism and the effects of the development boom in southern England in the late 1980s.[18]</b></p>
	<div>
		The Greens sought to build alliances with other parties in the hope of gaining representation at the parliamentary level. In Wales, the Greens endorsed Plaid Cymru (a welsh party) candidate Cynog Dafis in the 1992 general election, having worked with him on several environmental initiatives. For the 1997 general election, the Ceredigion branch of the Greens endorsed Cynog Dafis as a joint Plaid Cymru/Green candidate, but this generated controversy with the party, with critics believing it improper to build an alliance with a party that did not share all of the Greens' views. In April 1995, the Green National Executive ruled that the party should withdraw from this alliance due to ideological differences. During the 1999 European Parliament elections, the Greens gained their first Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), Lucas (South East England) and Jean Lambert (London). At the inaugural London Assembly Elections in 2000, the party gained 11% of the vote and returned three Assembly Members (AMs). Although this dropped to two after the 2004 London Assembly elections.
